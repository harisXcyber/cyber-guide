## 🎯 **The Permission Rule (NEVER BREAK THIS)**

### **You Can ONLY Test Systems Where:**

**1. You Own the System**
- Your own websites, servers, applications
- Personal lab environments

**2. You Have Written Permission**
- Signed penetration testing contracts
- Bug bounty program terms of service
- Explicit authorization from system owner

**3. It's Explicitly Legal**
- TryHackMe rooms
- HackTheBox machines  
- CTF competitions
- Security training platforms

### **Permission Template for Clients:**

```
PENETRATION TESTING AUTHORIZATION

I, [Client Name], as the authorized representative of [Company Name], hereby grant permission to [Your Name] to conduct security testing on the following systems:

Scope:
- Domain: example.com

## ⚡ **Gray Hat: The Dangerous Middle Ground**

### **What is Gray Hat Hacking?**
- Testing systems **without explicit permission**
- **Good intentions** (want to help)
- Report findings to system owners
- **Still technically illegal**

### **Why It's Dangerous:**
❌ **Still breaks the law** (intent doesn't matter)
❌ **Companies can prosecute** you
❌ **No legal protection**
❌ **Career suicide** if caught
❌ **Sets bad precedent**

### **Gray Hat Example:**
*"I found a vulnerability in Company X's website. I didn't have permission to test, but I reported it to help them."*

**Legal reality:** This is still unauthorized access under CFAA.

**Better approach:** Contact the company first, get permission, then test.

## 🎯 **Ethical Guidelines for Bug Bounty**

### **DO's:**
✅ **Read program scope carefully**
✅ **Respect rate limits** and testing windows
✅ **Report vulnerabilities promptly**
✅ **Don't access sensitive data**
✅ **Be professional** in all communications
✅ **Help with remediation** if asked

### **DON'Ts:**
❌ **Test out-of-scope assets**
❌ **Use automated scanners** if prohibited
❌ **Social engineer employees**
❌ **Access personal data**
❌ **Cause service disruption**
❌ **Publicly disclose** before resolution

### **Bug Bounty Red Flags:**
🚩 Programs with **unclear scope**
🚩 Companies with **no security contact**
🚩 **Government systems** (usually off-limits)
🚩 **Financial institutions** (heavy regulation)
🚩 **Healthcare systems** (HIPAA compliance)
